# Green city study
This project focuses on studying the distribution of trees in Paris city with the aim to spot areas and streets with low population of trees. It uses the dataset from open source paris website http://tiny.cc/xud6tz.
Also, in this project I look at the possibility of recommending tree types based on constructing a network of adjacent trees in paris (network is built using Gephi).
